<p>This dev environment was created to make it easier to develop dockerized node.js applications with configuration for typescript, prisma and jest.</p>
<p>Also included are some examples on how to test the prisma client aswell as the express server routes using jest.</p>
<p>I link this stack particularly because it enables for rapid prototyping so its perfect for creating MVPs for Startups or other small projects.</p>
<h2 id="why-dockerized-dev-environment">Why Dockerized Dev Environment?</h2>
<p>The reason why I created this dev environment is to further my knowledge of using docker which I had the pleasure of getting to know during my last semester in uni as part of the Distributed Systems course.</p>
<p>Also this environment enables joint development of a backend server for a React Native application I am currently developing with a few friends, cutting down on setup time for individual devs.</p>
<h2 id="decisions-made">Decisions made</h2>
<p>For test execution I decided to include shell commands to directly execute the jest commands within the server, at a later point I might decide to include a separate container just for testing.</p>
<p>Prisma is used on one hand for the ease of setting it up and on the other hand for the advantages it provides over juggling objects between the server/database and the client by hand.</p>
